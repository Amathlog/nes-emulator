# NES emulator

Little pet project to try and code a NES emulator. The end goal is to make it available via C++ and also Python, to link it with a ML setup.

This project is cross-platform and should work on Windows and Linux.

Based on the wonderful tutorial from OneLoneCoder: https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcNES
